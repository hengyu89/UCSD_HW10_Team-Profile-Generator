# UCSD_HW10_Team-Profile-Generator
This program is to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Testing is key to making code maintainable, so it will also write a unit test for every part of our code and ensure that it passes each test.
